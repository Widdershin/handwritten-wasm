# handwritten-wasm
wasm examples, brought to you by humans!

**Why would anyone want to write wasm by hand?**

There are a few reasons:

 * you want to to learn about WebAssembly and how it works!
 * you're compiling code to WebAssembly
 * you want to actually write some for use in a project, perhaps for performance
 
Reading machine generated wasm is not always a fun experience, so if you want to learn, it's best to read wasm written by humans.

If you know of any others, please add it to the list!

*N.B. Strictly speaking, all of the examples are wast, not wasm, but that somewhat goes without saying when humans are involved.*
