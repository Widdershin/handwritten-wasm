# handwritten-wasm
Wasm examples, brought to you by humans!

**Why would anyone want to write Wasm by hand?**

There are a few reasons:

 * you want to to learn about WebAssembly and how it works!
 * you're compiling code to WebAssembly
 * you want to actually write some for use in a project, perhaps for performance
 
Reading machine generated Wasm is not always a fun experience, so if you want to learn, it's best to read Wasm written by humans.


**List of handwritten Wasm examples**

 * [WebAssembly/wasm-jit-prototype](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-jit-prototype/tree/master/Test/wast) (handwritten echo and tee)

If you know of any others, please add it to the list! I'm especially interested in larger handcrafted Wasm programs, rather than small examples.

*N.B. Strictly speaking, all of the examples are wast, not Wasm, but that somewhat goes without saying when humans are involved.*
